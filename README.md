# drive-opener
Force a specific browser to open google drive files  

## Usage
Change the default program for `.gdoc`, `.gsheet` and `.gslides` to :  
- *Windows* : `execWindows.bat`
- *Linux*   : `index.js`


## Motivation
I use Firefox as my main browser. I use Google Drive for work.  
I sometimes need to use collaborative files offline, which is possible thanks to a chrome plugin.  
Double-clicking on the file in the explorer opens in the default browser, which hasn't this plugin, so I can only open offline file through the web explorer, which takes more time and overall is less efficient.
